# 📊 YouTube Behavioral Analytics Pipeline

![Dashboard Screenshot](HomePage.png) 

## 📝 Project Overview
An end-to-end data analytics project focused on transforming **16,000+ personal YouTube viewing records** from raw, unstructured HTML into a high-fidelity interactive dashboard. This project demonstrates the full data lifecycle: from automated scraping to UI/UX design and behavioral insight generation.

## 🚀 Technical Stack
* **Data Engineering:** Python (BeautifulSoup) for Web Scraping & Data Cleaning.
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI (DAX & Power Query).
* **UI/UX Design:** Figma (Custom Dashboard Interface & Backgrounds).
* **Project Management:** Trello (Agile Workflow).

## 📋 Project Management (Trello)
I managed this project using **Trello** to implement an Agile workflow, ensuring each phase was completed efficiently:
- **Phase 1:** Data Extraction (Python Scripting).
- **Phase 2:** UI/UX Design (Figma Wireframing).
- **Phase 3:** Data Modeling (Power BI & DAX).
- **Phase 4:** Insights & Documentation.

## 🛠️ Data Pipeline
1. **Extraction:** Developed a **Python script** to parse raw HTML files (Google Takeout), extracting `Title`, `Channel`, and `Timestamp`.
2. **Design:** Created a custom theme in **Figma** to optimize visual hierarchy and user experience (UX).
3. **Analysis:** Modeled the data in **Power BI** to track consumption trends and engagement patterns.

## 📈 Key Insights (Anonymized)
* **Volume:** 16,000+ total videos analyzed.
* **Daily Average:** 51 videos watched per day.
* **Peak Hours:** Engagement spikes significantly between **8:00 PM and 11:00 PM**.
